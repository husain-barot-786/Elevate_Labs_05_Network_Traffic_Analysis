# Network Protocol Analysis Report

## Environment
- OS: Kali Linux
- Tool: Wireshark v4.x

---

## Traffic Generation Summary
1. **ICMP traffic** using `ping google.com`
2. **DNS + TCP + HTTPS traffic** by visiting `https://www.youtube.com` in Firefox

---

## Protocols Identified
1. **ICMP**
   - Packet Type: Echo Request/Reply
   - Destination: 142.250.190.xxx (Google IP)
   - Filter Used: `icmp`

2. **DNS**
   - Resolved `youtube.com` to IP addresses
   - Filter Used: `dns`

3. **TLS (HTTPS)**
   - Encrypted YouTube connection
   - Observed TLS handshake (Client Hello, Server Hello)
   - Filter Used: `tls`

4. **TCP**
   - Verified 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)
   - Used for HTTPS communication

---

## Screenshot Summary
Captured key steps from Wireshark interface selection to protocol filtering, ping, web browsing, and saving.

---

## Notes
- HTTPS traffic was encrypted; payload not visible.
- Proper packet layering observed: Ethernet > IP > TCP > TLS
- Used filters to isolate each protocol efficiently.
